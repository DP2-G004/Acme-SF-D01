This is a starter project.  It is intended to be a core learning asset for the students
who have enrolled the Design and Testing subject of the Software Engineering curriculum of the 
University of Seville.  This project helps them start working on their new information system 
projects.

This project is going to be developed throughout the Design and Testing II course. The objective of this project is to learn about the subject
while working as if we were a real-life team; creating a new branch for every issue or task we encounter.

Our team is formed by frajimmor2, antporara, josgardel8, javsanmar5 and javruigar2
